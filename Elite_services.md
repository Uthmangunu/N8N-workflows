5. Lead Scoring and Internal Routing
5.1 Priority Criteria
Mark a lead as high priority if one or more of the following apply:
●
●
●
●
●
Timing: “Within 48 hours” selected.
Office/FM cleaning where:
○
Size is over an agreed threshold, and/or
○
Cleaning frequency is “Daily” or “Several times per week”
.
Multiple locations selected.
Airbnb/short‑let with “4+” checkouts per week.
Large end‑of‑tenancy or deep clean jobs (e.g. 3‑bed+).
5.2 Lead Score
The system should calculate a simple score (for example 1–10) using:
●
●
●
●
Service type
Size / number of locations
Frequency
Urgency
Leads above a configurable threshold (e.g. 7+) should be tagged internally as “HOT”
.
5.3 Routing Rules
●
High‑priority office/FM and multi‑site leads: send immediate email and/or
Slack/WhatsApp notification to the named Elite Services contact(s).
●
●
Other leads: send to a standard inbox and store in the lead log, with clear indication
of channel and service type.
Non‑sales queries (jobs, support, invoicing, complaints) should be tagged and
optionally routed to a different address or process.
6. Data Handling and Integrations
6.1 Data Destinations
●
●
●
Central lead log:
○
Either a Google Sheet/Airtable, or
○
Directly into the chosen CRM (if in use).
Instant email notification to a designated Elite Services email address for every
completed lead.
Optional webhooks or connectors into job‑management or quoting tools.
6.2 Minimum Fields per Lead Record
Each lead entry must include at least:
●
●
●
●
●
●
●
●
●
Date/time
Source channel (Facebook organic, Instagram DM, Instagram ad, etc.)
Name, phone, email

All relevant property/site details from the chosen path
Timing/urgency
Whether they are comparing multiple quotes
Lead score and flags (e.g. HOT, multi‑site, urgent)
Link to full conversation history/transcript
7. Behaviour, Tone and Fallbacks
7.1 Tone of Voice
●
●
●
●
Friendly, professional, and concise
UK English
References to London where appropriate
Helpful and solution‑focused, not pushy
7.2 Natural Behaviour
To avoid feeling robotic, the system should:
●
●
●
Use a realistic delay/“typing” indicator between messages rather than replying
instantly every time.
Rotate between several variants of common acknowledgements (e.g.
“Thanks, got
it.
” / “Perfect, thank you.
” / “Great, thanks for confirming.
”).
Ask polite clarifying questions instead of saying it “doesn’t understand”
.
7.3 Handling Free‑Text and Off‑Topic Messages
If the user writes something unexpected:
●
●
●
Acknowledge their message.
Where possible, answer briefly or steer back to the key questions.
If it’s clearly outside the script (complaints, support, jobs, etc.), ask for any necessary
contact details and state that someone from the team will follow up.
7.4 Human Handover
●
●
●
There must be a way for Elite Services staff to step into the conversation and reply
directly when needed.
Once a team member replies manually, the automated flow should pause for that
conversation unless explicitly re-enabled.
User‑facing wording should describe this simply as “someone from the team”
replying, without mentioning automation.
8. Privacy and Consent
Before asking for contact details, include a short privacy note such as:
“We’ll only use your details to contact you about cleaning and
facilities‑management services. You can read our privacy policy here: [link].
”
The implementation must comply with applicable data‑protection requirements (e.g. UK
GDPR).
